Really, more of just an organizational structure for the program.

1) Set up connection to server [DONE]
2) A method for determining how much money to be betting (and also something to hold the amount of money currently?)
3) Sending bet money
4) Get cards, and use some risk-analysis algorithm to determine whether or not to HIT/STAND
5) Send decision to server... as needed.
6) Do something about counting cards
7) Repeat.
